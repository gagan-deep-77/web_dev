            Instructions:
            Make the Dough:

            In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until the dough starts to come together.
            Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
            Prepare the Sauce:

            In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
            Assemble the Pizza:

            Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C).
            Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll out each half on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            Transfer the dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.
            Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust.
            Sprinkle mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese evenly over the sauce.
            Add your favorite toppings.
            Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
            Serve:

            Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
